# Gruvbox color scheme for KDE

## Install

Copy the Gruvbox.colors file to the **${XDG\_DATA\_HOME}/color-schemes** folder
(usually **~/.local/share/color-schemes**) or use **Import Scheme** button from
**KCM** (System Settings) -> **Color** and select the Gruvbox.colors file.

## Note

This was tested only on KF5, although KDE4 apps look good in KD5.
